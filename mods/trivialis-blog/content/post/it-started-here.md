**trivialis.org** *day 0*

The challenge for this blog is to present most, if not all, examples as *turn-key* samples.

While all entries will attempt to include explanation snippets, the aim is to minimize use of, otherwise beloved *copy-and-paste*, and provide full source code with *ready-to-run solutions* (did anyone said **immutable**?).

The intention is to create samples that can be **tested** and **automated** as this is, IMHO, the only human possible way for me to maintain the blog.

*...time will tell ...*
