**trivialis.org** *day 0*

The challenge for this blog is to present most, if not all, examples as *turn-key* samples.

While all entries will attempt to include explanation snippets, the aim is to minimize the use of *copy-and-paste* (otherwise beloved), and provide full source code with *ready-to-run solutions* (did anyone said **immutable**?).
<!--more-->

The intention is to create *samples* that can be **tested** in **automated-fashion** in order to *minimise* the time necessary for **updates** and/or **maintenance**.
